# mvc-java-play-framework
In this article, I will be developing a ***Model-View-Controller (MVC)*** application using **Java** and **Play Framework**.

## Overview
We will build a ***MVC application using Java and Play Framework*** for a **Todo Task Application** in that:

- Each **Todo Task** has *id, title, description, creation date, due date, status and comments*.
- User can *Create New Task, Update Existing Task, View All Tasks as List, View a Task and Delete a Task*.

## Requirements
- **Java (v8 - 11)** - **Play** Framework suports **Java versions SE 8 through SE 11**, inclusive. Support for latest Java versions are experimental and can be used, *by making some tweaks*
- **Scala build tool (sbt)** - **Play** provides an enhanced development experience (support for routes, templates compilation and auto-reloading) when using the **sbt**.
